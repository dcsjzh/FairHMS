# FairHMS
A C++ implementation of FairHMS in our paper "Happiness Maximizing Sets under Group Fairness Constraints". All baseline algorithms we evaluate in our experiments are also available online. Please refer to https://users.cs.duke.edu/~ssintos/kRMS_SEA/ for the implementation of eps-Kernel, Greedy, and HittingSet(HS); and https://www.cse.ust.hk/~raywong/code/sigmod18-sphere.zip for the implementation of DMM and Sphere.

## Datasets
The synthetic datasets are generated by the generator (S. Börzsönyi, D. Kossmann, and K. Stocker. The skyline operator. In ICDE, pages 421--430, 2001.). 
The real datasets includes:
1. The Lawschs dataset includes 65,494 students’ information from 25 law schools from 2005 to 2007. We use two numerical attributes, namely LSAT score and GPA, and two demographic attributes, namely gender and race, in our experiments. Available: http://www.seaphe.org/databases.php
2. The Adult dataset is a 5𝑑 dataset with 32,561 tuples, each of which contains an individual’s education years, capital gain, capital lose, work hours per week and overall weight. The dataset is divided into groups by gender and race. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/adult
3. The Compas dataset is a 9𝑑 dataset of size 4,743. It consists of customer data from an insurance company. Each tuple denotes an applicant’s insurance number of days, count of priority, comprehensive score, and so on. The dataset is partitioned by gender and whether the insured is recidivous. Available: https://github.com/propublica/compas-analysis
4. The German dataset is a 7𝑑 dataset of 1,000 tuples about German credit information. The dataset is divided according to job, housing condition and number of employment years. Available: https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/statlog+(german+credit+data)

## Usage
1. compile: cd src; make;
2. run: cd executable; ./run.out dataset NumberofCategories k is2D (e.g. "./run.out anti_6_100_skyline.txt 1 10 0" for the high dimensional datasets, "./run.out anti_2_100_skyline.txt 1 5 1" for the 2D datasets);
3. The results are in the folder "results".
